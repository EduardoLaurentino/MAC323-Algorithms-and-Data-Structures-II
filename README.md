# MAC323-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-II
Program Exercises for the Algorithms and Data Structures II course at IME-USP

Goal:
Present widely used data structures and algorithms and discuss their implementation and performance.

Sylabus:
Abstract data types and their implementations. Time and space complexity analysis (worst case, average case, amortized analysis, empirical estimates). Symbol tables: balanced search trees, hash tables, ternary search tries. Graphs: depth- rst search, breadth- rst search, shortest paths (Dijkstra's algorithm), topological sort, strong components. Text processing: regular expressions and automata, pattern matching (KMP algorithm, Rabin-Karp algorithm), data compression (Huffman codes), su x arrays. Optional topics: B trees, LZW algorithm for text compression, memory management (garbage collection).
